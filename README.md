# CoppeliaSim-UNDERDOG-IED-Robot
Compact Moving Explosive Device as Reinforcement against Tanks for Infantries - Automated Explosives Carrier Robot.

This project is able to replicate the use of “dog-mines” in the past by delivering destruction right to the face of the opponents armored vehicles, and is more costefficient rather than participating in a tank-to-tank combat. We are hoping the future development of this device that could be used as a security device like the domain’s guard for protecting properties and territories like in the conflicted borders or not-yet-cleared domains full of landmines.

This project is simulated using CoppeliaSim Player (V-REP), the .ttt file is available in this repository for you to simulate it your self.

The big and white vehicle is simulated as a tank and controlled by user using keyboard arrow button.
The small moving object is the UNDERDOG Robot that moves autonomously.
